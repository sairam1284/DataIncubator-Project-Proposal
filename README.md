## Some helpful information about the Road Types and Bike Lane types

### FUNCTIONAL - Identifies the functional classification of roadway
  * 0 = Local
  * 1 = Interstate
  * 2 = Principal arterial
  * 3 = Rural minor arterial
  * 5 = Urban minor arterial or rural major collector
  * 6 = Urban collector or rural minor collector


### ExisFacil - Identifies the current bike facility type. See “Bicycle Facility Descriptions” below for further details.

* BFBL = Buffered bike lane BL = Bike lane
* BLSL = Bike lane on one side, shared lane on the opposite side
* BSBL = Bus/bike lane
* CFBL = Contra-flow bike street NSUP = Shared use path, natural surface
* NW = Neighborway, marked NW-U = Neighborway, unmarked
* SBL = Separated bike lane SBLBL = Separated bike lane on one side, bike lane on the opposite side
* SLM = Shared lane markings SRd = Shared road
* SUB = Shared use path bridge SUP = Shared use path
* TC = Traffic calmed street WALK = Walkway


### Initial Observations

<b>Total Number of bike lanes in Boston (miles) </b>

       90.29 Miles
       
<b>Total Miles of Road in Boston:</b>

       1165.46 Miles
 
<b> Total Miles of Road in Boston with a speed limit which is 25mph or under </b>

      974 Miles

**This Means that** Of the 1100 miles of roads in Boston, there are only 90 miles of road which have some sort of method to allow for bikes. There are 974 miles of roads in Boston which have a speed limit 25mph or under.  This could be a huge opportunity to consider adding more bike lanes to.  In addition
